Important Facts about Bitwise Operators:
The left shift and right shift operators cannot be used with negative numbers.
The bitwise XOR operator is the most useful operator from technical interview perspective. We will see some very useful applications of the XOR operator later in the course.
The bitwise operators should not be used in place of logical operators.
The left-shift and right-shift operators are equivalent to multiplication and division by 2 respectively.
The & operator can be used to quickly check if a number is odd or even. The value of expression (x & 1) would be non-zero only if x is odd, otherwise the value would be zero.
